## 5 Design Patterns
1. Prompt chaining
    
    Prompt chaining is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) where a series of prompts is used to guide a large language model (LLM) to generate a desired output.

2. Routing
    
    Routing refers to the process of directing user queries to the most appropriate agent for handling them. This is particularly useful in multi-agent environments where different agents specialize in specific tasks or areas of expertise.

3. Parallelization

    Executing multiple agents or tasks concurrently, rather than sequentially, to achieve faster processing or more efficient resource utilization

4. Orchestrator-Worker
    
    In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.

5. Evaluator Optimizer
    
    In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop.
